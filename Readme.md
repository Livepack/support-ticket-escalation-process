# Support Ticket Escalation Process

This repository provides a standardized process and template for support service specialist agents to follow **before escalating tickets** to the technical team. The goal is to enhance service quality, reduce ticket resolution time, and eliminate inefficiencies caused by incomplete information and miscommunication.

## 🔍 Purpose

- Increase the quality of provided service
- Reduce the closure time of tickets
- Minimize effort for the technical team
- Prevent overlap, frustration, and misunderstandings between teams
- Establish consistent expectations across support tiers (L1 & L2)

## 📌 Process Overview

### 📝 1. Problem Description (Handled by L1)

- **Impact**: Briefly describe the effect of the issue  
- **Environment**: Specify the tools, services, and configurations involved  
- **Observed Behavior**: Detail what is happening  
- **Expected Behavior**: State what should occur under normal conditions or the end-user’s intended outcome  

### 🔧 2. Troubleshooting Steps Taken (Handled by L1 & L2)

- Check internal knowledge bases for similar issues  
- Identify anomalies or discrepancies  

### 🚀 3. Finalize and Escalate (Handled by L2)

If unresolved, escalate with full and precise context:

- Summarize the issue  
- List all troubleshooting steps and their outcomes  
- Clearly state the desired result  

## 📚 Additional Support

To support adoption and training, sample Microsoft 365 case descriptions will be provided under the `examples/` directory for educational purposes. These examples are designed to illustrate effective usage of the escalation template in real-world scenarios.
